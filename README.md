# 📈 Linear Regression 

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a **Linear Regression model** using Python and Scikit-learn.  
The model is trained on a housing dataset to predict house prices based on input features such as area.

Linear Regression helps in understanding relationships between variables and making predictions for continuous values.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this task is to:

- Import and preprocess dataset  
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Train a Linear Regression model  
- Evaluate model performance  
- Visualize regression results  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
### Step 1: Install required libraries
```bash
pip3 install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
### Step 2: Run the program
```bash
python3 linear_regression.py
```

## ⚙️ What the Program Does

The script performs the following steps:

- Loads the housing dataset
- Selects feature (area) and target (price)
- Splits data into training and testing sets
- Trains Linear Regression model
- Predicts house prices
- Calculates evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R²)
- Plots regression line graph

---

## 📊 Output

The program displays:

- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score
- Regression line graph

These metrics help evaluate model performance.
