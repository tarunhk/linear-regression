# 📈 Linear Regression 

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a **Linear Regression model** using Python and Scikit-learn.  
The model is trained on a housing dataset to predict house prices based on input features such as area.

Linear Regression helps in understanding relationships between variables and making predictions for continuous values.
